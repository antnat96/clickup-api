# ClickUp API Interface V1
This repository holds a collection of functions (both JS and PHP) that work together via jQuery's AJAX functionality to make calls to/collect data from ClickUp's web application.

Specifically, these functions are to be used in a CodeIgniter environment. Front-end is not represented in this repository.
